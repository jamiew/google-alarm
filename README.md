Google Alarm
------------

This Firefox browser add-on visually & audibly notifies you when Google
is monitoring & recording your web browsing, e.g. you're visitng pages
that have Google Analytics, AdSense, YouTube embeds, and of course,
when you are using Google products directly (Gmail, google.com, etc).
All of these send data about you & your browsing habits back to Google.

Big Brother is watching, and his stock ticker is GOOG!
