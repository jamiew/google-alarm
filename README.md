Google Alarm
------------

A browser add-on that notifies you when Google is
monitoring & recording your web browsing, e.g. pages that have
Google Analytics, AdSense, YouTube embeds, and of course,
when you are using Google products directly (Gmail, google.com, etc)

Big Brother is watching, and his stock ticker is GOOG!
